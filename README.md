<h1>Project Hindsight</h1>
<p>This program is designed to inform users about when they should have bought and sold a stock to maximize profit, and what that profit would be.</p>

<h3>Current User Story:</h3>
<p> Users can now track multiple equities. Users can see stock changes over time, and hover over individual points on the axis to see specific prices and dates. Users also see the best time they could have bought and sold to maximize their profit. </p>

<h3>Is there anything in your program that is incomplete? </h3>
<p>No</p>
<h3>If you were to continue to add to this project, what would be some additional user stories that you would like to see?</h3>
<p>We would like to allow users to search the stock price in customized dates and would further improve the UI with FXML </p>
